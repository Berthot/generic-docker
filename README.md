# Docker Compose - MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, and ActiveMQ Setup

This project provides a pre-configured Docker Compose setup to easily deploy a development environment with MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, and ActiveMQ Artemis. It's perfect for developers who need a quick and reliable way to run these services locally, whether you're testing, developing, or just integrating things together.

Each service comes with default settings, including health checks and persistent storage, making sure everything runs smoothly and is easy to manage. This setup is ideal for projects with microservices or applications that rely on message queues, databases, and caching.

## Profiles

We have divided the setup into different profiles to help you choose what services to run depending on your needs:

- **basic**: Runs only MongoDB, suitable for minimal setups.
- **full**: Runs MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ, and ActiveMQ Artemis.
- **cache**: Runs only Redis, ideal if you're focusing on caching.
- **messaging**: Runs both RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ Artemis for messaging scenarios.
- **telemetry**: Runs Elasticsearch, Kibana, and the Elasticsearch initializer for telemetry and data visualization.

## üö® Important Note on Running Services with Profiles üö® 

If you're using profiles in your `docker-compose.yml`, the command `docker-compose up -d` alone will not start the services that are defined under profiles. 

You must explicitly specify which profiles you want to run using the `--profile` flag.

## Running Multiple Profiles at Once

You can combine profiles to run multiple services as needed by specifying multiple `--profile` flags.

### How to run more than one profile

```bash
docker-compose --profile basic --profile cache --profile telemetry up -d
```

This will start all the services from the selected profiles.

### How to run specific profiles

- To run the full setup (all services):

  ```bash
  docker-compose --profile full up -d
  ```

- To run the **basic** version (MongoDB only):

  ```bash
   docker-compose --profile basic up -d
  ```

- To run Redis as a cache:

  ```bash
  docker-compose --profile cache up -d
  ```

- To run only the messaging services (RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ Artemis):

  ```bash
  docker-compose --profile messaging up -d
  ```

- To run Elasticsearch and Kibana for telemetry:

  ```bash
  docker-compose --profile telemetry up -d
  ```

## üõ†Ô∏è How to use powershell script

1. Define the project path:

   - At the beginning of the script, change the variable $projectPath to the path of your Docker project directory:

      ```txt
      $projectPath = "C:\Users\YourUser\Path\To\Your\Project"
      ```

2. Save the file:
   - Copy the script code and save it in a file with the .ps1 extension, for example, docker-functions.ps1.
3. Run the script in PowerShell:
   - Open PowerShell and navigate to the directory where the .ps1 file is saved.
   - Execute the script to import the functions:

      ```bash
      .\docker-functions.ps1
      ```

4. How to execute:

   - How to run more than one profile

     ```bash
     dockerup basic cache telemetry
     dockerdown basic cache telemetry
     ```

   - To run the full setup (all services):

     ```bash
     dockerup full
     dockerdown full
     ```

   - To run the **basic** version (MongoDB only):

     ```bash
     dockerup basic
     dockerdown basic
     ```

   - To run Redis as a cache:

     ```bash
     dockerup cache
     dockerdown cache
     ```
